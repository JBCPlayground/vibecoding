""Awareness"" by Anthony De Mello is a profound spiritual guide that challenges readers to ""wake up"" from the unconscious patterns that govern their lives. Originally transcribed from spiritual conferences given by De Mello, a Jesuit priest and psychotherapist who integrated Christian spirituality with Buddhist, Hindu, and psychological insights, the book presents a direct and sometimes confrontational approach to spiritual awakening. De Mello argues that most people live in illusion, controlled by cultural conditioning, attachment to success and failure, and the opinions of others, which prevents them from experiencing true happiness and freedom. Through short, accessible chapters filled with parables, stories, and penetrating observations, he advocates for cultivating awareness—a state of observing oneself and reality without judgment or attachment—as the path to genuine love, joy, and liberation. The book's central premise is that happiness is our natural state, obscured only by the false beliefs and unconscious behaviors we've absorbed from society, and that by becoming truly aware and present, we can reclaim our authentic selves and experience life as the abundant feast it truly is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,Reading,,,,,,,,,,

""Things That Matter: Three Decades of Passions, Pastimes and Politics"" by Charles Krauthammer is a collection of essays spanning thirty years of the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist's work, originally published in outlets like The Washington Post, Time Magazine, The New Republic, and The Weekly Standard. The book became a #1 New York Times bestseller and showcases Krauthammer's range as both a leading conservative thinker defending limited government and an independent intellectual whose views on issues like feminism, evolution, and the death penalty defied ideological convention. Divided into four sections—personal, political, historical, and global—the collection covers everything from bioethics and American foreign policy to border collies and baseball, while its autobiographical introduction reveals Krauthammer's journey from medicine to political commentary and his belief that politics, though perhaps less noble than art or science, ultimately matters most because ""in the end, everything – high and low and, most especially, high – lives or dies by politics."" The book demonstrates Krauthammer's distinctive combination of intellectual rigor, stylistic elegance, and willingness to challenge conventional wisdom across the political spectrum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,Reading,,"Book of Five Rings, The",,,,,,,,

""The Fifth Risk"" by Michael Lewis is a work of narrative nonfiction published in 2018 that examines the Trump administration's transition to power through the lens of three federal agencies: the Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce. Lewis explores how the incoming administration's lack of engagement with the transition process and dismissal of career civil servants created vulnerabilities in critical government functions that most Americans take for granted. The book argues that the greatest risks facing the nation aren't just the obvious threats like nuclear accidents or extreme weather, but rather the ""fifth risk""—the risk that comes from abandoning or failing to understand the essential work of government, particularly in areas like managing the nuclear stockpile, predicting severe weather, and ensuring food safety. Through detailed reporting and character-driven storytelling, Lewis illustrates how dedicated but largely invisible government employees work to protect public welfare, while highlighting the potential consequences when their expertise is ignored or devalued during political transitions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,Reading,,"Fifth Risk, The",,,,,,,,

""The Peripheral"" is a 2014 science fiction novel by William Gibson that weaves together two interconnected timelines through a sophisticated time-communication technology. The story follows Flynne Fisher, a woman living in a near-future rural America marked by economic decline and environmental degradation, who witnesses what she believes is a murder while remotely piloting a security drone for her brother's mysterious job. She soon discovers she's actually been observing events in London roughly seventy years further into the future—a world that has survived ""the jackpot,"" a gradual apocalypse of overlapping catastrophes that decimated humanity. The novel explores themes of technological determinism, economic inequality, and the mutability of the future, as characters from both timelines attempt to alter events and navigate the ethical implications of cross-temporal interference. Gibson's characteristically dense prose and world-building examine how information technology can create new forms of power and exploitation while blurring traditional boundaries of time, space, and agency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,Want to Read,,"Peripheral, The",,,,,,,,

Daniel Mendelsohn's An Odyssey: A Father, A Son, and an Epic is a profound memoir that weaves together classical scholarship and intimate family reflection. The narrative centers on an unexpected turn of events when Mendelsohn's elderly father, Jay, enrolls in his son's college seminar on Homer's Odyssey. Through their shared exploration of the ancient epic—in the classroom, on a Mediterranean cruise retracing Odysseus's journey, and in their evolving conversations—the book examines universal themes of homecoming, identity, and the complex bonds between fathers and sons. Mendelsohn draws brilliant parallels between the characters of the Odyssey, particularly Odysseus and Telemachus, and his own relationship with his father, creating a layered meditation on aging, mortality, and the ways ancient stories continue to illuminate our modern lives. What emerges is both a loving tribute to Homer's enduring masterpiece and a deeply moving exploration of family, loss, and the journeys—literal and metaphorical—that define our search for meaning and connection.",https://fcplcat.fairfaxcounty.gov/search/title.aspx?ctx=1.1033.0.0.1&pos=1&cn=283712,Kindle,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33571159-an-odyssey?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=txyNUCxrd1&rank=1,,,An_Odyssey_-_cover.jpg,,,,,,2017,William Collins,,No,Tess Kline,,Reading,,"Odyssey: A Father, A Son, and an Epic, An",,,,,,,,
